This repo contains experiements I have made with p5.js

To watch them :
1. Clone this repository on your local system (check out the github documentation to learn how to do it)
2. Go to a folder with an index.html and sketch.js file.
3. Open the index.html file in your browser. It should work with Google Chrome or Firefox. Try both if something goes wrong.
